- Hello, i'm Estio or Estions, both will work.
- I'm currently a student doing comp-sci. And looking for freelance front-end webdev experience/work.
- At this point in time i am confident is using C#, Java, CSS and HTML...  PHP is still a strange thing for me and JS i haven't even touched.
When it comes to other things, i'm decent-ish with working on Unity projects.
- If you have any questions - feel free to message me on twitter @___estio.
